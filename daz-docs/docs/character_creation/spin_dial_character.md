# Dial Spin Characters
Making characters with Daz Parameters like an avatar in a video game.
## Process
* Load the base figure
* Dial parameters
## Saving the Character

## Additional Morph Parameters
Dial spin characters can be built using default parameter morphs, but for more flexibility we recommend installing our official Head and Body morph addons. A user must own these products to work but they are best sellers.
