## Saving JCMs

- Sometimes morphs on the figure get projected to follower content (ie. clothing or hair) and messes things up. If you are having that problem usually you would fix the morph, but sometimes the fix is to turn the morph off so it doesn't do anything.
- This video is merely showing you how to shut the morph off.
- Simply turn off auto follow and change the content type of the morphs so they will save properly when you save the follower content.

## Using Smoothing to Fix Clothing

![type:video](https://www.youtube.com/embed/D5XpT5vDlkI)

- Using the smoothing modifier to fix up morph problems in clothing. DAZ Studio automatically projects morphs from Genesis figures to clothing but the results aren't always the best. This shows how to use tools included with DAZ Studio to fix up the morphs.
- WARNING: Using this method to fix issues is a little heavy handed and can cause issues of its own. For instance, if you rotate the right thigh in to the limit and apply smoothing to fix poke through on a pair of shorts, you are causing the right thigh to intersect with the left and what you can't see is now you are pushing the geometry on the left thigh of the shorts inside the leg. You are fixing one issue but causing another.
