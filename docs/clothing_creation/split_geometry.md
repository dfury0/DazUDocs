- Split an outfit into several pieces without losing the morphs or rigging, for example splitting a top and skirt into 2 separate items after rigging them as one piece.
- After loading the outfit you want to split up, save out a ***new\*** file so you avoid accidentally overwriting the current file. I always choose a new product name as well as new item name to be safe.
- Select the geometry editor tool and then select the polygons you want to remove or split out from the current outfit.
- Right click in the viewport and choose Geometry Visibility | Hide selected polygon(s). After checking that polygons that you didnâ€™t want to delete are not hidden right click again in the viewport and choose Geometry Editing | Delete Hidden Polygon(s).
- Save the item again, and reload to test and make sure the polygons are gone. Reload the original outfit and do the same with the other polygons that you want to delete for example first save out the top part, and then save the skirt part 2nd time around.
