## How to Sell 3D Products on Daz3D.com

1. **Familiarize yourself with Daz Studio and the Daz 3D ecosystem:** Before you begin, get comfortable with Daz Studio, the primary software used by Daz 3D customers. Explore the software, understand its capabilities, and learn how to create content that appeals to the user base.
2. **Create a Daz 3D account:** If you haven't already, sign up for a Daz 3D account at [https://www.daz3d.com](https://www.daz3d.com). You'll need an account to access the store, forums, and submission process.
3. **Research the market:** Browse the Daz 3D store to understand the types of products that sell well. Look for market gaps or popular themes you can create content around. This will help you develop a strategy for creating and marketing your products.
4. **Develop your 3D content:** Create high-quality, unique 3D models, characters, props, or environments compatible with Daz Studio. Make sure your content is polished and user-friendly. For example, you may want to create product documentation, such as user guides, to help customers use your products effectively.
5. **Prepare your product for submission:** Organize your files, create promotional images, and write a clear, concise product description. Ensure your content meets Daz 3D's technical and quality standards, as the submission guidelines outline.
6. **Apply to become a Published Artist:** To sell your products on Daz 3D, you must first become a Published Artist. Visit the Daz 3D Published Artist page ([https://www.daz3d.com/pa/landing](https://www.daz3d.com/pa/landing)) and follow the application instructions. This process typically involves submitting a portfolio of your work and waiting for approval.
7. **Submit your product:** Once accepted as a Published Artist, you can submit your products to the Daz 3D store using the Published Artist Submission System (PASS pass.daz3d.com). Follow the guidelines provided and be prepared to make any necessary revisions based on feedback from the Daz 3D team.
8. **Work with Quality Assurance:** Our QA process can be rigorous to ensure the best product experience for our users. 
9. **Promote your products:** After your product is live in the Daz 3D store, it's essential to promote it. Share your product on social media, participate in the Daz 3D forums, and network with other artists and customers. Effective promotion can help drive sales and build your reputation as a 3D content creator.
10. **Keep creating and refining:** As you gain customer experience and feedback, continue to develop new products and update existing ones. Staying active and responsive to customer needs can help you maintain a successful presence in the Daz 3D marketplace.
