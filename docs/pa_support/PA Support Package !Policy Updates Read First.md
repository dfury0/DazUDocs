# Standards Updates 2023-03-16

All following notes are QA Standards and are **required practice**. Unfortunately, the product will be returned for changes if these standards aren't met.

Please regularly check the PA Support Package, which you can download from your account. Be aware that things are changing continually, and while we know it can be frustrating if things change, we feel it is necessary to create the best content possible for the Daz customers. Future updates will also be posted in this newsletter.

##  TIP files: 

TIP PNGs (**91 x 91** to **256 x 256**) are required. Please note they do NOT replace the original PNGs, but rather accompany them and provide a better customer experience. TIPs are Information PNGs that allow you to write some text for product use or to make it easier to see what the file is when you hover over it. So please ensure your products adopt their use as soon as possible. Thank you!

See For [All Products](PA Support Package All Products.md#PNGs) for more information on PNGs

## File Names

There have been some concerns with the renaming of files. Please note that these are required for a multitude of reasons. 

* Files overriding other files

* Metadata issues on our end and the customer's end

* Organization and categorization

See [For All Products](PA Support Package All Products.md#Naming) for more information on naming.

### Character Names

* Must have the Product name in front of all files, including if you chose to use PA initials, for example - LT Character Name, LT Character Name Eyes Green
* On the characters, they need to be named LT Character Name G8 Female or Male, LT Character Name G8.1 Female or Male (same As Genesis 3)
* Character data files should also have the PA initials in front so character files do not override others.
* See [For All Products](PA Support Package All Products.md#PNGs) for more information on PNGs

### Naming Clothing, Hair, Poses, Props: 

* All files must have the Product Name in front.

* **Material** files need to be uniquely namedâ€”no **Blue 01** etc. The Product Name (or Product Initials) should also be in front.

* **Poses** need to have what the pose is. Example, **LT (PA Initials) Fury (Product name) Running 01** or LT **Fury Laying 02**, etc. Poses especially are the main same like naming across the board.

* **Props** need to have the product name in front of all files. If both 3Delight and Iray are included, they must be named accordingly (Product Name Sofa Iray and Product Name Sofa 3Delight).

* Please put **spaces** between words in the file's name. Long file names cause issues in Studio. Do not use "\_" but  "-" is acceptable.

* See [For All Products](PA Support Package All Products.md) for more information on PNGs

### General Product Naming

* (s\) is no longer used after Female or Male in the product name

* Please fully capitalize product names - '**LT mama for genesis 8. female**' should be '**LT Mama for Genesis 8.1 Female**'

* When making products for male and female figures, remember to add \"**for Genesis 8 or 8.1 Males or Females**" or "**8 and 8.1Male and Females.**"
  * LT Mama for Genesis 8.1 Female
  * LT Mama for Genesis 8 or 8.1 Female
  * LT Mama for Genesis 8.1 Male and Females

## PASS

See [PASS Tutorial]([PA Support Package Pass Tutorial.md) for more information on filling out PASS

### Updating Live Products
* Make a new PASS page with the Name of the Product Update, updated files in a zip, and a reason for the update, as QA must update the ReadMe.
* This also goes for Promo art, even if the product is **NOT** live, as all new promos need to go through the review process again.
* **Please fill out as many of the areas as you can (that are applicable)**

### Multiple Products to release at the same time and Bundles

* If uploading several products you want to be released together, please, in title notes, put 1 of 4, 2 of 4, etc. (however many there are), with the last one being the bundle page. 
* If creating a bundle, please select the Bundle option from the Product Type dropdown, and after creating the products for the Bundle, scroll down and add the products in the Sub Product box. Once the products are added to PASS, they will pop up for you. Help with this is in the PA Support Package. There must be at least three products to make up a bundle.

## Genesis 9 Character Proportions

Genesis 9 characters should be built on the same proportions as the base figure, which helps to make clothing and other items work better with more characters. They must have separate proportion dials if you want to change proportions on anything. You can create custom proportion dials or, better yet, use the ones supplied with Genesis 9. These can be implemented in two ways:

* The proportion dials are dialed up by the character preset. This is generally the best way, as it allows for easier bleeding of character shapes.
* If the character looks unusual without the proportions dialed in, you can dial them up with the control(CTRL) dials.

## Separates

Please ensure that how you separate your product makes sense from a customer's point of view. We are happy to help if you have questions. Two cups shouldn\'t be separated if they look almost identical. If it's just a simple pair of socks, please put them in the shoes, etc. Separating them extensively will not increase your sales.
