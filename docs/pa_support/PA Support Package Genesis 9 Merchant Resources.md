Specific pieces of the Genesis 9 content are allowed to be used as a
"Merchant Resource" as explained in this document.

# Definition of Merchant Resource

A "Merchant Resource" is a piece of content that can be used as a
starting point in your own content. Daz is not giving up our ownership
of the content, we are providing you with a license to use it in a
limited way.

Only content listed in this document should be used as a merchant
resource and only within the usage rights spelled out below.

# Merchant Resource Usage Rights

-   These merchant resources can be used as starting points for any
    content that will be sold on the Daz store.

-   Filenames must change to prevent conflicts

-   In general the merchant resources must change enough so they aren't
    obviously the same. A couple examples:

    -   Less obvious items such as roughness or specular maps don't need
        to be changed but it would be required for the color and SSS
        maps.

    -   Creating a head or morph pack that is simply a renaming of the
        merchant resource files is not allowed

-   If a product using the merchant resources is rejected by the Daz
    review team, the product may not be distributed on other sites
    without first removing the content derived from the merchant
    resources
