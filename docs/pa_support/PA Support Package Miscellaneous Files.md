  Package Miscellaneous Files"

There are a couple miscellaneous files We would like to draw your
attention to.

1.  Daz3D Store Tag Marks Template.psd

    A.  Located in PA Support Package\\Runtime\\Textures\\Daz
        3D\\PASupportPackage.

    B.  This is to be used when creating thumbnail images so that the
        pink or green overlay tag does not interfere with the image.

    C.  You can preview where the overlays will be if you use the image
        directly in the "Environment" tab.

        1.  No matter what camera POV the overlays will always be in
            > same position.

        2.  You can use this at the end, and you may need to hide stuff
            > in background.

2.  Image Card Template

    A.  Located in PA Support Package\\Runtime\\Textures\\Daz
        3D\\PASupportPackage.

    B.  FBM and Control Dial Image cards should be 147 x 185.

    C.  FHM image cards should be 91 x 91.

    D.  The illustration should be positioned on the left 70% of the
        > image and should contain only enough detail to indicate what
        > the control does. Do not include a background. Observe the
        > usual "family friendly" rules for images.

    E.  By design, the figure in the image can overhang the top and left
        > boundaries. The bottom should be clipped just inside of the
        > border for the bottom boundary, and the right should stop or
        > fade into the background as it get to the vertical slider
        > boundary. The intent is that the figure appears as though it
        > is protruding out of the card.

    F.  The image should be located with the .dsf file in the data
        > folder, e.g. ...data\\DAZ 3D\\Genesis
        > 8\\Female\\Base\\Morphs\\DAZ 3D\\Base. Since the image path is
        > defined in the Presentation Editor, the naming convention of
        > this file is not critical, but it is recommended that the name
        > match the name of the parameter it will be displayed on.
