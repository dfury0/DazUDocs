A)  Make sure that "dForce" is spelled correctly

B)  Create a Ground plane

    i.  Create a new Primitive: Plane

        1.  Always make the divisions bigger than 1, if it is at 1 the
            > dimensions are not big enough to use dForce.

C)  Simulate Clothing

    i.  Go to the Simulation Settings and click Simulate

    ii. Make sure the outfit simulates correctly.

    iii. There should be no poke-through, no "explosions", and Daz
         Studio should not crash.

    iv. When simulating, you may find that you will need to apply
        included morphs to help with the colliding. After simulating,
        use morphs, clear simulation and then simulate again.

    v.  Watch draping carefully. There could be a few reasons if draping
        > isn\'t as it should be. One is there are extra polys along the
        > edges. Suggest removal of these Polys. Another reason is the
        > item may need SubD\' again. Rule of thumb is the smaller the
        > squares the better the draping

    vi. Most dForce items do not need the dForce surface settings messed
        with. If draping is incorrect or items don\'t seem to be acting
        correctly (maybe blowing up when simulating) suggest the PA
        default the surface settings

    vii. If you find items like to stick to legs or feet no matter what
         you do or no matter how much you change the pose, if you go to
         tool settings and do the geometry editor section. you can
         highlight the area that is sticking to the leg. right click
         then geometry visibility - hide unselected. it will just leave
         the area sticking. and get rid of all the extra fabric to see
         if it is sitting too close to the leg.

> You can then let the PA know what they may need to do

viii. Layered clothing should have the collision layers (in the surface
      pane under simulation settings) numbered.

D)  If other asset types are included, see appropriate document.

E)  Daz Original Clothing saves for once the textures come in need to be
    saved as a wearable preset instead of support asset-\>Figure Prop
    Asset so that it preserves the actual clothing settings.

F)  Material Presets for Daz Original dForce clothing need to have NO
    simulation settings in them. If there are settings saved in the Mat
    Presets send them back to the PA with a link to Josh's video on how
    to save them out properly..

G)  The following link needs to be added to the description of ALL
    dForce outfits.
