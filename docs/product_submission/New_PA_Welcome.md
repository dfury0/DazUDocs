## Welcome to Daz!

All your paperwork is complete, and you have your PASS link, now for the good part! Let’s get you making some money. So what happens next?

## How do I submit my work?

 Let’s take you through your first PASS submission. These are the key points in the process. 

 **Validation:** 

- Before submitting your product, you will use our handy dandy Validator, it will spit out a list of easy to fix errors, for example, a needed file is missing. Once your product passes Validation, save your report, and send it in with your product. Validator will be available in your account once you accept the EULA

**Product Reviews:** 

- Once uploaded, our review team will review your work. We meet daily Monday to Friday to review all new submissions. At every stage of the process, you will receive an email that tells you if any comments or requests have been made. Please address the comments and if required, make the changes and re-upload your product to the same PASS submission.
- It’s possible that our review team will comment on your work. Don’t fret, this is just to ensure that your product meets our quality standards, and aims to help your sales. Higher quality = more money in your pocket

**Declining a product.** 

- Our team strives to help you make your product the best it can be, but on the odd occasion if it doesn't meet our standards (quality or otherwise), we reserve the right to decline it. You can definitely re-submit with changes to meet our standards.

**Brokering vs. Buyout** 

- If you want to offer your product for buyout, PASS allows you to click Daz O and fill in your desired Buy Out price. Our team will respond, either accept your offer, negotiate a different price or move the item forward as brokered. If Daz buys your product, you will be paid once it passes QA. All future revenue will go to Daz 3D. Artist credit will be yours unless otherwise requested by you.
- Brokering your product will give you 50% of total revenue (exceptions plugins). 

**Quality Assurance**

- All of our products go through a rigorous QA process. Don’t be surprised if you hear from one of our team asking for revisions. A product will not go live and you will not get paid, until our QA standards are met. 

**Marketing**

- Once you pass QA, Marketing will schedule the release of Brokered Content. When it releases is entirely up to them, average times are within a few weeks. You will be notified on PASS when your product is scheduled so no need to ask. If your product is bought by Daz 3d, the Daz 3d Content team will schedule the release. Don’t be surprised if we hold on to your product for awhile. Often times we have a themed bundle planned that we want your product to be included in.

**Timelines** 

- Average timelines are 30 days from submission to release
- What impacts these timelines?
  - Review 
    - If our team asks for changes the faster you get them to us the faster they get to QA. Please ensure to check our guideline documents to ensure that your products meet ALL guidelines or changes will be requested.
  - QA
    - The more time you spend ensuring that there are no QA errors, the faster it will go through QA. Standard times are 10 business days. 
  - Queue 
    - Busy times of year affect releases. For example, holidays and sales have an increased load on the staff at Daz 3d. For holidays and themes like Halloween, Christmas etc, please allow a minimum of 6 weeks to ensure that your product will release on time. 

**Release**

- Congrats! You’ve published your product on Daz 3D. 

 

## Brokered vs Buyout vs Commission

 There are three avenues that products fall under. Here’s how it works

 **Brokering:** 

This is the most common method of product selling. This just means that the product is put up on the store and we split the lifetime revenue 50/50. The product rights are still held by the broker (artist).

**Buyouts:**

This is when we see a submission that we want to buy from the artist for a lump sum, instead of splitting the sales. If you want to take the initiative and offer the product as a buyout, you can tick the box that says "Daz O" on the PASS page before submitting and list the price you'd like to sell it for. Your name stays on the product no matter what, but Daz Productions owns the product.

 This is what you should expect if you sell your product to us. 

- After agreeing to a price, the product will go to QA to be tested. 
- Once it passes, it will be in "Final QA" status. Within 2-4 business days, you'll receive a contract that you'll need to sign and return as soon as possible. 
- You'll receive the agreed payment on the next payout date. These dates can be seen in [this stickied forum post](https://www.daz3d.com/forums/discussion/465416/2021-buy-out-submission-dates-cut-off-pay-out) (Must be a PA to see this post) 

 When the review team offers a buyout for a product that you didn't offer to us, you don't need to feel pressured to accept it. It all depends on whether you want to have sales over time, or receive a lump sum up front. What you choose to do with your products is up to you.

 **Commissions:**

We like to reach out and collaborate with PA’s to commission content for our DO releases. The themes are always varied so there is something for everyone. The process is built around discussions with the production team (sometimes reference/inspiration images are provided), buyout price is agreed, product developed and then signed off. Once it has passed through QA, contracts and payment is made and you will see your name on the next exciting Daz 3D product release.

## Pre-Release

Daz artists are given early access to major release characters in order to provide supporting content upon release. To access these pre-releases, follow these steps to sign the EULA:

1. Log in
2. Navigate to your account page
3. Go to Vendor Tools
4. At the top of the PA Portal, there will be a notification if there is a EULA to sign
5. Scroll down to the bottom of the page where the EULA appears and sign it

 Once signed, it will be automatically added to your account where you can download it.

 *Please note the section in the EULA that prohibits using the pre-release items to create or sell products at other stores within the first 60 days of release.

## Getting Paid

It’s time for the part you’ve been waiting for! 

 PA's can be paid via PayPal, Direct Deposit (United States only), or wire transfer.

 When do I get paid?

 PayPal: Every 2 weeks on the 15th and End of the Month

- Direct Deposit: Once per month, paid out at the end of the Month with a minimum commission payout of $50.
- Wire Transfer: Once per month at the end of the Month but incurs a $25.00 fee (plus potential further bank charges, check your bank for details)

 If a pay date falls on a Saturday, payment will be made on Friday. If a payment falls on Sunday, payment will be made on Monday.

If a payment falls on a Holiday, payment may be made the day before or the day after the Holiday depending on the day of the week.

 

Payment terms are “Net 30”, meaning payments are made 30 days following the end of the pay period. For example, if you are paid once per month via Wire or Direct Deposit, commissions earned Jan 1-31 are paid at the END of February.

If you are paid via PayPal, commissions earned Jan 1-15 are paid Feb 15 and so on. 

 

What is my commission?

 

Vendors earn 50% commission on Net Sales. That means 50% of revenue after sales and discounts.

 

Can I earn a bonus or higher commission percentage?

 

Yes, Daz offers bonuses ranging from 30% to 2% to the top 100 Vendors based on 60-day revenue average. If you are eligible for a bonus an online notice will appear on your account. The amount of the bonus will be added to your account several days after the end of the month and will be paid out at the end of the following month with your other month-end payment. 

 

Where can I see my product sales?

 

Log in to your Daz account and go to the “Vendor Tools” Tab.

 

What are the Payment Cut Off & Pay Out dates?

 

There is a [2020 calendar here](https://www.daz3d.com/forums/discussion/389451/2020-buyout-submission-dates-cut-off-pay-out#latest) showing the dates which payments are made, and when cut-offs are imposed (when handling buyout contracts) so please refer to this if you want to know when your payment will be made.

 

Can I change my method of Payment?

 

If you wish to update your payment details please [file a ticket](https://dazpasupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).

This primarily covers content and information surrounding new character/figure releases, future technology developments, beta software, information in the PA forum etc.  We love to have PA’s contribute and collaborate with our new efforts, but this can only be done on the basis that information provided stays within the context of the company.

 

Please read this fully before you sign, and if you are unsure about what you may or may not share, please ask us.

 

HD Morph vs General 

 

BLURB

 

Please note to access the HD Morph Loader Pro, you will need to sign a separate NDA. Please be aware that unlike other content, HD content cannot be marketed, sold or even distributed for free at any other site. This includes any HD content we may choose to decline.

Annual PA Reviews

 

While marketing regularly reviews your sales and performance, we also annually review the amount of content that each PA submits and offer feedback and encouragement when we see PA’s stop releasing content. 

 

Life gets in the way sometimes, and that’s fine, but be aware that if we see an extended period of inactivity we reserve the right to revoke your status as a PA and your store will be removed. We will reach out to discuss the situation beforehand, and if the situation can’t be resolved you will get a 10 day notice before termination of your PA status. Even in this instance, we review your back catalogue and may offer to purchase your content so it remains in the store.

 

## Interactive Licenses

Customers are allowed to use all products on the store for 2D purposes (both for personal and commercial use). To use the product for 3D purposes commercially, customers need to purchase an interactive license. All Daz Originals offer Interactive Licenses. For PA-owned products, it’s up to the artist to decide if they want to offer it or not.





## PASS Stages Explained

4. Copy Approval
   1. Our in-house copywriter checks the product description for spelling mistakes and grammatical errors

   1. Product is actively being tested. You may see the status change back to Ready to Test if the tester takes a break or runs out of time for the day.
7. PA Corrections
   1. The tester has reached out to you via email about necessary fixes needed to your product. You have access to the files in this stage to update them.
