## hOW TO DAZ

Daz 3D invites artists from around the world to sell their products on our web store. Here's how to apply to become a Published Artist.



**New applications need to go [here](https://dazpasupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new).** Select the option that says "New PA Application". Be sure to attach several examples of your work. Strongest applications show a wide variety of potential products that are well presented, just as you would wish the product to be shown in the store. In the description, please introduce yourself and explain what you're presenting.

 

Here are the types of products we sell as well as:

- Characters (always enclose close up renders of the skin texture)
- Poses
- Hair models (include renders from all angles including from the back)
- Clothing Models
- Textures (for clothing or figures)
- Props
- Scene models (sometimes called environments)
- Lighting setups

 

If your product falls outside of these types of products such as software, software plugins, tutorials, etc - please provide screenshots showing what your product can do. For items like music loops or sounds effects provide samples (some subset of examples) so that the review team can understand your product. Make sure that you include promo imagery, making it as dynamic as you can so that Daz 3D can see how you would like to market your product.
