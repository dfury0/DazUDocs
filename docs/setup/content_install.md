## Installing Daz Content for Content Creators

Managing Daz content is designed to be convenient for users. They can install content directly from their Smart Content pane, using  DAZConnect, the Daz Install Manager (DIM), or directly from Zips downloaded from the Daz3d.com website.

### Manual Installing from Zip files

* Zips give you the most control over your folder structure
* Allows you to isolate content for testing
* Our Quality Assurance Team installs content they are testing
* Working with zips is the best way to make and test individual products and testing, but is not convenient for managing a large content library 

### DAZ Install Manager (DIM)

* Recommended for installing Daz Studio, updates, and most products 

### DAZCentral with DZConnect

DAZConnect is not recommended for content creators. It may be the most convenient way to install content for users, but you have no control over the folder structures. An added Digital Rights Management system also scrambles content locations so it is almost impossible to isolate products for testing.

It is easy to bump a parameter, test a texture,  and unintentionally create a dependency on another product while you are working on content. No warnings will appear because the content manager can find this content in your content library. This is a benefit for content users, but frustrating when you are creating content because users may see errors you never did.
