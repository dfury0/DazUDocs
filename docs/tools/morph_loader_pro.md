# Morph Loader Pro
Morph Loader Pro is used for loading morphs onto a character or prop. It is a workhorse for building Daz Content, especially for characters, clothing, and hair. Like many content creation tools, Morph Loader Pro is not visible in the default layout. You should [change to a more advanced Daz Studio layout for content creation. City Limits is a good choice.](../setup/layout.md)  

Morph Loader Pro works with OBJ files. The vertex count must be the same and the vertex order must match. It is not uncommon to lose vertex order in importing and exporting from software.

## Saving and reusing presets

## Importing and exporting and OBJ from Blender
Blender is a powerful modeling tool but its default OBJ import and export settings will change the daz vertex order. This breaks the content for Morph Loader Pro and can be very frustrating. You need to preserve vertex order on import and export.
