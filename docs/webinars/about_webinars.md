Learn Tips and Tricks for our resident expert - Sr. Technical Artist Josh Darling.  From 2017 to 2019 Josh gave open session webinars to our artist community addressing requested information and how to do this. 

Some webinars focused on new features and have since become outdated, but many of the workflows and principles shown are just as relevant today.
