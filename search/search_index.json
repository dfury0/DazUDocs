These are then hooked up with set driven logic.The common corrective amounts range from 20 - 40 correctives, depending on how far the character deviates from the base.</p> </li> <li> <p>FACS based expression correctives for the head - the core figure has a set of FACS based expression blendshapes. Often these will not perform optimally for a new character face shape and correctives for some of the targets will have to be made.</p> </li> <li> <p>Tear geometry fit shape - Genesis comes with a separate \u201ctear\u201d geometry add-on that fits around the edge of the eye socket and over the eyeball.

Then we will scale it in Daz Studio. It might be strange to have giant babies and tiny monsters, but our avatar system works better with normalized scales. </p> </li> <li> <p>Proportion Changes - When it comes to changing the proportions of your character we have found it is best to rough in the proportions of the character in Daz Studio in the beginning. We have morphs and scaling properties available for head scale, hand scale, feet scale, limb lengths, limb thickness, etc. and this tends to be cleaner than doing the adjustments in another tool. Make sure the 1chin area is aligned with the Genesis base chin, letting the feet go through the floor or float above the floor (see video starting around 1:00 for an explanation)</p> </li> <li> <p>Landmarks - When sculpting, landmarks are important: lip lines, eyelid edges, navel, need to be maintained between all shapes on Genesis for blend stacking, texture alignment, and accessory elements (eyebrows, eyelashes) to work successfully. Every blendshape has to use the topology in the same basic way.</p> </li> <li> <p>Landmark Drift - It is best to avoid landmark drift, topology dragging, or pinching etc. This is the cleanest method for having fewer issues later that would require a custom corrective for other shapes, expressions. or bends, etc. You can get around being this strict while sculpting if you plan later to manually fit a cleaned version of our base topology around, re-project the details and clean up any errors at the end.</p> </li> <li> <p>Mesh Resolution - We usually sculpt a character at either 5 or 6 divisions of our base mesh in Zbrush for right now. (4.2m \u2013 16.7m polygons). We ship both a low cage topology blendshape, and an extracted higher detail difference blendshape of each character. The two are then stack-able to achieve the final character.

Look for any smashed/ separate, odd mesh.\n\n    ii. Add a UV checker jpg to the surfaces and check the\n        following:\n\n        1.  Make sure there is no stretching - squares and numbers\n            should be consistent size.\n\n        2.  Checked for flipped Normals - all numbers should read\n            the same direction.\n\n        3.  Also use different tiling sizes to make sure that\n            textures will melt together correctly.\n\n        4.  Make sure to do this after any mesh changes as they UV's\n            can get messed up on resaving.\n\nb.  Check the materials.\n\n    i.  Make sure that all of the materials apply to the clothing\n        correctly.\n\n        1.

The Character morph should be named the same name as the\n      character you are testing.\n\nix. Dial up each morph individually.\n\nx.  Scale should be driven by the main character control\n    property (CTRL), not the body morph\n\nxi. Morphs that move the mesh significantly, should also move\n    the relevant bones.\n\nxii. Pose controls move bones.\n\nxiii. Make sure morph limits are set.\n\nxiv. For multiple morphs for a character after testing each\n     morph, make sure that it is at 0% before moving on to the\n     next morph.\n\nxv. Make sure to be consistent between points and percentages.\n\nxvi. Morphs should show up in both the Parameter and Shaping\n     Panes.\n\nxvii. Hidden morphs-morphs in the HIdden group-should be hidden,\n      not visible.\n\nxviii. For HD Characters/morphs, Viewport subDivision Level\n       should not exceed 2 (1 is fine). Render subDivision level\n       should not exceed the morph's level.\n\nxix. Make sure that the head and body morph images go to the\n     Dark Gray borders. Ideally, it should not go beyond or\n     cover the morph name.\n\nxx. The dials for the character Morphs need to be placed in the\n    correct groups.\n\nxxi.

In the description, please introduce yourself and explain what you're presenting.</p> <p>Here are the types of products we sell as well as:</p> <ul> <li>Characters (always enclose close up renders of the skin texture)</li> <li>Poses</li> <li>Hair models (include renders from all angles including from the back)</li> <li>Clothing Models</li> <li>Textures (for clothing or figures)</li> <li>Props</li> <li>Scene models (sometimes called environments)</li> <li>Lighting setups</li> </ul> <p>If your product falls outside of these types of products such as software, software plugins, tutorials, etc - please provide screenshots showing what your product can do. For items like music loops or sounds effects provide samples (some subset of examples) so that the review team can understand your product. Make sure that you include promo imagery, making it as dynamic as you can so that Daz 3D can see how you would like to market your product.</p> <p>Again, please be sure to submit your application to become a Daz Artist here and review the above guidelines before doing so.</p>"},{"location":"product_submission/promo_artwork_standards.html","title":"DAZ 3D PRODUCT ARTWORK STANDARDS","text":"<p>The following are the artwork standards and requirements for product page artwork.

In this webinar we talked about QA standards for dForce cloth. Specifically, the question of Triangles versus Quads came up. We stated that our official line is that we prefer meshes that are mostly quads and any dForce content that DAZ is commissioning or buying out cannot be primarily made up of tris. We have decided to revise that statement. There are cases where meshes made of tris will work as well as or even better than quads and that our proposed policy of saying that we will accept only quads for Daz originals is probably too narrow. Therefore, we are revising our policy to be based strictly on results. While we recognize that triangulated meshes won't support shear functionality, they will support draping and bends for certain fabric simulation types better than quads. Bottom line...we are backing off of saying we will not accept triangulated meshes... and we ARE saying that the mesh makeup must be consistent with the cloth or material type being simulated. Sometimes that will be tris.. .and sometimes it will be quads... or a combination of the two. </p>"},{"location":"webinars/webinar_50.html","title":"50 | Webinar - June 21, 2018","text":""},{"location":"webinars/webinar_50.html#video","title":"Video","text":""},{"location":"webinars/webinar_50.html#timestamps","title":"Timestamps","text":"<ul> <li>Publishing Build update (00:00)</li> <li>Silent OBJ Export script for symmetrical Genesis exports (05:45)</li> <li>Zelara update (19:05)</li> <li>Using surface horizontal offset to display numbers on an object (Maclean tutorial) (21:38)</li> <li>Script samples to help animate in a similar way (26:25)</li> <li>Shader preset to change offsets (30:43)</li> <li>PASS update - new layout and features (37:00)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"webinars/webinar_51.html","title":"51 | Webinar - June 28, 2018","text":""},{"location":"webinars/webinar_51.html#video","title":"Video","text":""},{"location":"webinars/webinar_51.html#timestamps","title":"Timestamps","text":"<ul> <li>Publishing Build update (00:00)</li> <li>Tips and discussion on keeping file sizes small (04:55)</li> <li>Texture compression for smaller files (10:59)</li> <li>SubD on items for smaller files (12:10)</li> <li>8bit/16bit maps, .png/.jpg maps for smaller files (13:13)</li> <li>HD morphs, removing morph vertices by changing tolerance in Morph Loader Pro for smaller files (16:45)</li> <li>Scene files for smaller files (25:20)</li> <li>Product file compression for smaller files (32:11)</li> <li>Shader Definition Assets (should be saved whenever you customize in Shader Mixer)  (34:13)</li> <li>.djl files, Postload script, data folder for smaller files (35:45)</li> <li>.tip.png sizes (46:10)</li> <li>dForce hair updates (50:05)</li> <li>dForce hair UV maps (01:02:03)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"webinars/webinar_52.html","title":"52 | Webinar - July 19, 2018","text":""},{"location":"webinars/webinar_52.html#video","title":"Video","text":""},{"location":"webinars/webinar_52.html#timestamps","title":"Timestamps","text":"<ul> <li>Property Types (00:00)</li> <li>Gamma Settings (10:20)</li> <li>UV Mapping and QA requirements (16:35)</li> <li>Figure template scale differences (24:16)</li> <li>Texture map sizes (40:00)</li> <li>Quixel reference guide on good UV mapping (45:15)</li> <li>Surface Selection Sets (47:23)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"webinars/webinar_52.html#note","title":"Note","text":"<p>We had troubles getting our guest presenter working correctly in this one so the video link above is reduced to just the parts where I led a discussion.</p>"},{"location":"webinars/webinar_53.html","title":"53 | Webinar - July 26, 2018","text":""},{"location":"webinars/webinar_53.html#video","title":"Video","text":""},{"location":"webinars/webinar_53.html#timestamps","title":"Timestamps","text":"<ul> <li>Promos: Render drafts, cleaning up noise for (guest speaker Dimension Theory) (00:00)</li> <li>Dimension Theory\u2019s photoshop actions for noise removal (01:10)</li> <li>Noise removal steps in detail (09:08)</li> <li>Nvidia Iray Draw Mode and Draw Settings for render drafts (24:25)</li> <li>dForce Hair update (preserving curly hair shape, buns and ponytails) (54:30)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"webinars/webinar_53.html#note","title":"Note","text":"<p>For more up-to-date dForce Hair information please look for the most recent webinars instead</p>"},{"location":"webinars/webinar_54.html","title":"54 | Webinar - August 2, 2018","text":""},{"location":"webinars/webinar_54.html#video","title":"Video","text":""},{"location":"webinars/webinar_54.html#timestamps","title":"Timestamps","text":"<ul> <li>dForce Hair updates (00:00)</li> <li>Hair collision tips (01:44)</li> <li>Hair explosion tip (08:08)</li> <li>Sink and Align Tool (including walkthrough) (08:45)</li> <li>Tips on building hair (46:55)</li> <li>Posing a cable prop (01:06:20)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"webinars/webinar_54.html#note","title":"Note","text":"<p>IMPORTANT: Much of this webinar was spent showing a process that we said would eventually make it into a tool that will do it with a click of a button.
