Genesis is an avatar system. Genesis \u201ccharacters\u201d are blendshapes, stacked onto a unified base topology and rig. Genesis has a fixed topology. It cannot be changed. There are ways to temporarily replace areas of the model with new geometry called geografting used for tails, wings, etc. discussed elsewhere, but it still relies on matching topology. Genesis figures have one set of skinning weights and they cannot be altered. Likewise, the figure\u2019s bone list also cannot be altered. Joint center points, however, must be edited to be in the proper location for characters that need different limb lengths, etc. note: our Adjust Rigging to Shape tool automates this process. Genesis Bone orientations can be altered, but generally should not be. It causes problems with posing and animation. You can change proportions and shape quite drastically while character sculpting but the overall pose of the character needs to match the original genesis mesh. What makes up a Genesis \u201cCharacter\u201d? A Genesis character will generally consist of the following components. A low-resolution character blendshape Fits around the volume of a high-resolution shape. Split into head and body shapes inside Daz Studio. A high-resolution character blendshape contains HD details not captured by the low-resolution model. Separate navel and nipple blendshapes - that will be loaded additively to the core figure navel and nipples in our software. They should not be a part of either the high or low-resolution character shape. Pose space corrective blendshapes for the body - once the joint centers have been moved into proper position for the low resolution character shape, the figure joints are then posed to positions where a sculpted corrective already exists in the base and:If the posed shape is found aesthetically insufficient, a custom one for that character is created. These are then hooked up with set driven logic.The common corrective amounts range from 20 - 40 correctives, depending on how far the character deviates from the base. FACS based expression correctives for the head - the core figure has a set of FACS based expression blendshapes. Often these will not perform optimally for a new character face shape and correctives for some of the targets will have to be made. Tear geometry fit shape - Genesis comes with a separate \u201ctear\u201d geometry add-on that fits around the edge of the eye socket and over the eyeball. Often with new character shapes this will not fit properly, and a custom character fit will have to be made. Eyelash geometry fit shape - Genesis comes with a separate \u201ceyelash\u201d geometry add-on that follows the edge loop of the eye rim. It too sometimes performs poorly with new character shapes and requires a custom fit be made. Body shape set corrections - Genesis has a set of core body and head shapes that are sold. We do try to at minimum correct the worst-performing shapes in the sets. Normal map exports - Because the low and high-resolution character shapes are sold separately, we bake a set of normal maps from the final character files, high to low, to ship with the low-resolution character product. Safest to do this at the end of the process. Character Sculpting Scaling - Keep character blendshapes the same scale as the base, so all characters have a uniform volume. Otherwise, blendshapes on the figure will be too strong, or weak. When you want a character to be bigger or smaller (ie a child or a monster) you still sculpt it at the same scale as genesis. Then we will scale it in Daz Studio. It might be strange to have giant babies and tiny monsters, but our avatar system works better with normalized scales. Proportion Changes - When it comes to changing the proportions of your character we have found it is best to rough in the proportions of the character in Daz Studio in the beginning. We have morphs and scaling properties available for head scale, hand scale, feet scale, limb lengths, limb thickness, etc. and this tends to be cleaner than doing the adjustments in another tool. Make sure the 1chin area is aligned with the Genesis base chin, letting the feet go through the floor or float above the floor (see video starting around 1:00 for an explanation) Landmarks - When sculpting, landmarks are important: lip lines, eyelid edges, navel, need to be maintained between all shapes on Genesis for blend stacking, texture alignment, and accessory elements (eyebrows, eyelashes) to work successfully. Every blendshape has to use the topology in the same basic way. Landmark Drift - It is best to avoid landmark drift, topology dragging, or pinching etc. This is the cleanest method for having fewer issues later that would require a custom corrective for other shapes, expressions. or bends, etc. You can get around being this strict while sculpting if you plan later to manually fit a cleaned version of our base topology around, re-project the details and clean up any errors at the end. Mesh Resolution - We usually sculpt a character at either 5 or 6 divisions of our base mesh in Zbrush for right now. (4.2m \u2013 16.7m polygons). We ship both a low cage topology blendshape, and an extracted higher detail difference blendshape of each character. The two are then stack-able to achieve the final character. It is important that high poly sculpt be animation clean as well. Alignment - Before exporting, make sure the head is aligned properly. This is important because we split the character sculpt into a head and body shape. See the video starting around 2:50 for an explanation Basic Workflow We highly recommend a quick test of the first 3 steps and send us your high resolution mesh. We will verify it is still compatible with our mesh before you put any substantial time into a sculpt. Video showing steps 1 and 2 Load the target figure mesh (Genesis 8.1 Male or Female) and rough in the body proportions. This needs to be done with the Dev Load version of the mesh that loads without any morphs applied and doesn\u2019t have the eyelashes or tears. Make sure to pay attention to the notes in the \u201cCharacter Sculpting\u201d section above before proceeding Export the cage resolution mesh to OBJ Easiest to use the script that we include in \"/People/Genesis 8 Male/Developer Kit/\" for exporting OBJs Import into ZBrush (or the tool of your choice), subdivide in ZBrush to the desired resolution and sculpt the character shape (making sure to avoid workflows and tools that break vert and facet compatibility with the original mesh, such as breaking it up into subtools) Export the shape (at the desired resolution) to OBJ Use Morph Loader Pro in Daz Studio to import the shape as a morph target at HD resolution. IMPORTANT: The shape you are working with throughout this entire process should not have navel or nipples included. Those will be created/loaded later Apply a tiling texture to the surfaces of the figure and set your morph to 100%. You are looking for areas that distort badly in order to identify areas the shape needs to be fixed. If there are problems then go back into ZBrush and slide geometry around to remove the bad distortions and bring it back in as a morph. The original morph can be deleted or replaced. Once you are satisfied there isn\u2019t too much distortion in the sculpt you will need to build the base resolution morph. The most basic method is by doing the following: Set your morph (from the previous step) to 100% Set to base resolution, export cage version of the mesh Set to high res at SubD level 2 and export to OBJ. This will be used as a reference for fixing the volume of the base resolution morph Load the two meshes into a modeler, subdivide the base resolution version and place the subD level 2 (reference) mesh in the background. You should see all sorts of areas of the mesh where the high-resolution morph is poking through the base resolution mesh Pull the geometry of the base resolution mesh out to match the volume of the reference mesh. Pay special attention to areas around the face such as ears and lips With the optimized base-resolution and high-resolution versions of the character done you are ready to load these into Daz Studio as morph targets. You will end up with 4 morph targets: body, head, HD body, HD head. The naming convention is consistent so it is easy to follow. Substitute your character name for Victoria in the following example: Body - FBMVictoria8_1 Head - FHMVictoria8_1 HD Body - FBMVictoria8_1_HDLv4 The final number indicates subdivision level HD Head - FHMVictoria8_1_HDLv4 The final number indicates subdivision level To load the morphs: Apply Head Split DFormer Launch MLP and add base resolution morph twice First one will be the head morph, name per instructions above Set \u201cAttenuate By\u201d to the weight map and use default setting of 1 for the Strength Second will be the body morph, name per instructions above Set \u201cAttenuate By\u201d to the weight map and set Strength to -1 Click Accept Dial head and body morph, making sure to also verify the head split is good With both head and body morph set at 100%, launch MLP and add the HD morph twice. On both: Set Morph Subdivision to Yes, Built Resolution to 4, SubD Mapping to ZBrush (if subdivided in ZBrush, otherwise leave default) Set Delta Tolerance to 0.0001 Set Reverse Deformations to Yes First one will be the head morph, name per instructions above Set \u201cAttenuate By\u201d to the weightmap and use default setting Second will be the body morph, name per instructions above Set \u201cAttenuate By\u201d to the weightmap and set Strength to -1 Click Accept Fix issues that inevitably come up at this point, such as teeth and eye problems Generally the eyes and inner mouth should not be affected by the head morph other than to be moved into place, possibly some scaling if necessary Load base resolution OBJ as reference for where teeth and eyes should be With Geometry Editor tool select Teeth and Mouth surfaces Select both head morphs (base and HD) Run \u201cClear HD Morph Deltas (Faces)\u201d script Compare position of mouth and eyes to reference OBJ If position now needs to be fixed it could be done in DS or in an external modeler To do it in DS, create a dFormer, create weightmap that only affects the part you want to move, move it into place and export to OBJ. Delete dFormer Reload fixed head morph, making sure name matches so it will replace the current oneSave morph assets by running Save Morph Assets script Set Asset Directory to the project directory Set Vendor Name to \u201cDaz 3D\u201d Set Product Name to the name of the character, making sure to use \u201c_\u201d instead of a \u201c.\u201d (ie Victoria 8_1) Once the sculpt is loaded in and fixed up properly you will move on to the rigging portion of the process Rigging A Character \"Rigging\" a Genesis-based character involves the following: Moving the bone positions relative to the mesh changes of the character shape Joint Correction Morph Correction KEEP IN MIND: Sometimes a problem is caused by reckless sculpting (such as not maintaining landmarks properly or by sliding geometry around). Often it is best to go back into a modeler and fix the problem (while maintaining the original sculpted shape). As an example, if you find an area that is problematic with multiple morphs and/or joint bends you may want to save yourself time and fix the sculpt once instead of fixing each problem Other times you will find that building custom corrective morphs for a problem will be necessary. The number of correctives you will need to create is going to be different with every character and obviously will be highly influenced by how much you are changing the shape from the base mesh and how carefully it was built. Some characters end up with 0 corrective morphs for joints, some end up with 30 or 40 . In addition, it is pretty common to end up with another 20 to 60 corrective morphs to fix morph issues with various morphs on the genesis figure. Again, this number fluctuates based on how much change is introduced in the character shape and by how carefully the sculpt was done Moving The Bones Moving the bone positions relative to the character shape is a critical first step in rigging a character. This needs to be done on the base resolution version of the body and head morph and should be done one morph at a time. Below I will outline the basic steps when doing this manually. To get faster, more optimized results you can also consider purchasing and using this product instead. Dial the base resolution body morph to 100% Activate the Joint Editor Tool, right-click in the viewport and go to Edit > Adjust Rigging to Shape Right-click on Neck Upper and Uncheck Selected and Children Uncheck face groups related to the head (Head, lEye, rEye, LowerJaw, Tongue, UpperJaw) Click Accept Put Parameters Pane into Edit Mode, right-click on the body morph you dialed up and adjusted the bones to, click on ERC Freeze Make sure the list is only populated by body bone movements and click Accept. You should now be able to dial the morph up and down, watching the bones move with the shape Dial off the body morph and repeat steps 1-7 above but with the head morph, making sure to invert what you have selected in the dialog (this time you want all bones unchecked except starting from Neck Upper, and you only want the head related face groups) Joint Correction Correcting joint bend issues refers to moving the bone positions relative to the mesh changes and then evaluating every bone rotation to find issues. When an issue is found you evaluate what the best course of action is for fixing it. IMPORTANT: The rigging should only need to be done on the base resolution morphs. The HD morph is just the details so won\u2019t need much work done specifically for it. If details are sculpted in on the knees and elbows then a common corrective we make is one to smooth the knees and elbows when they bend. All HD work will get done after all the base resolution work is done. Common workflow would be: Dial body morph to 100% Start at toes, check each joint for bend issues, working your way up to the lower neck bone. To check for issues, rotate the bone on each axis, one at a time, from minimum value to maximum value To fix an issue: Export to OBJ the problem pose (ie lFoot Bend Up). Naming is very important and should follow the same naming formula every time. Morph Correction The rigging process doesn't stop there, however\u2026 Next, we evaluate how the character interacts with morphs on the face and any of the body ones that make sense to support (ie. breast morphs for the female). The morphs you need to check your character against are all either included with the Genesis mesh you are building for (look for purple or red properties) or are in the following products that you need to install: Genesis 8 Female Body Morphs Genesis 8 Female Head Morphs Genesis 8 Female Expressions Genesis 8 Male Body Morphs Genesis 8 Male Head Morphs Genesis 8 Male Expressions Morphs are split into two main types: Posing and Shaping. They can be found under the Panes by those names or by navigating in the Parameters Pane to the \u201cPose Controls\u201d group for Posing and the \u201cActor\u201d group for Shaping.

Often it is best to go back into a modeler and fix the problem (while maintaining the original sculpted shape). As an example, if you find an area that is problematic with multiple morphs and/or joint bends you may want to save yourself time and fix the sculpt once instead of fixing each problem Other times you will find that building custom corrective morphs for a problem will be necessary. The number of correctives you will need to create is going to be different with every character and obviously will be highly influenced by how much you are changing the shape from the base mesh and how carefully it was built. Some characters end up with 0 corrective morphs for joints, some end up with 30 or 40 . In addition, it is pretty common to end up with another 20 to 60 corrective morphs to fix morph issues with various morphs on the genesis figure.

It is important to work in Zbrush with the base resolution model, and Zbrush works best with the Single UDIM UV set. Character Sub-figures (Eyes/Mouth) DAZ Studio: Export Eyes and Mouth models separately. Eye and Mouth geometry should be exported individually from the G9 base model, at Base resolution. DAZ Studio: Eye and Mouth geometry are sub-tools. Any sub-figure geometry should be loaded into Zbrush as further subtools, and generally only moved or scaled globally. Using Morphs As Starting Point DAZ Studio: Do use the Base Feminine and Base Masculine as starting shapes. They are example characters and their shapes are free to use as exported starting points for character sculpting. They should not be extracted when loading your finished character blendshape. Your final character should be a standalone shape on the G9 base figure. Get masculine base files here Get feminine base files here DAZ Studio: Do use the morphs in the following packages to create starting shapes. Merchant resource blendshapes can be a good way to jump-start a shape before further character sculpting in an external program. The following packages are allowed for use this way. G9 Starter Essentials. Head or Body morph packages. Note: Blue morphs on the figure are merchant resources. Character Sculpting Process Feature Landmarks Zbrush: Do use the landmarks texture map. G9 comes with two landmark texture maps (masculine and feminine) based on the Single UDIM UV set. This map gives a visual indication of where landmarks such as lip borders, brows, elbows, knees, etc, are located on the topology. Sculpting landmarks consistently helps with shape and texture continuity across diverse characters. Landmarks such as the brow will help you determine where the card-based eyebrows will end up on the final character. Move the mesh accordingly. Head Proportions Zbrush: Don\u2019t change the size of the eyes unless\u2026 Standard human eyes do not deviate much in size or shape, and G9 eyes are measured to be within the average. This does not apply to stylized characters, e.g anime, cartoon, other. This does not preclude changing position. Body Proportions Zbrush: Don\u2019t change proportions via sculpting unless\u2026 Most characters should be sculpted in a proportion that maintains the limb lengths and heights of the base figure. This ensures a universal height for all characters. Some characters would by their nature not work with this rule, but they are likely to be outliers. This does not preclude the changing of volume, e.g, thinner or heavier characters. DAZ Studio: Do use the Proportion dials at the end of character setup. Proportion dials should be used at the end of character creation to create a proportion formula preset dial for the character. This decouples height from the character and gives the end user more options. Asymmetry Zbrush: Don\u2019t sculpt extreme character asymmetry unless... Most characters should avoid extreme degrees of asymmetry in their shape as that locks the character into an appearance customers may not appreciate. Asymmetrical fine details are generally fine. These would be small HD folds, lines, etc. Any required character-specific sculpted asymmetry can and should be included as an additive shape meant to work as an optional blendshape. Generally this means it should be done as a separate layer. This would include things such as: Scars, burns, boils, etc Uniquely extreme attributes too specific to be approximated with the base general set. DAZ Studio: Do use the asymmetry blendshape options included in the figure base to create a preset. Should you require more drastic asymmetrical aesthetics. There are many asymmetry blendshape options included with the G9 base. You can formula these asymmetry options to a secondary character parameter dial. Example: \u2018Victoria 9 Asymmetry\u2019, which would host all parameters you chose as an optional control. DAZ Studio: Don\u2019t use the asymmetry blendshapes for non-approved purposes. Asymmetry morphs should not be used in expressions or other posing functions. These are intended to provide asymmetry to a character shape only. Navel and Nipples Zbrush: Don\u2019t sculpt these as part of your character design. The navel and nipples on G9 are seperate shapes. Zbrush: Do sculpt any custom navel and nipple shapes as a layer. Sculpting the navel and nipple as a seperate layer in Zbrush allows easy extraction of those shapes at the end up the process. Those elements should be positioned according to the appropriate Landmark texture map. Eyes Zbrush: Don\u2019t use brushes to sculpt on the eye topology. The eye figure is best adjusted as needed globally; translation and scale. Sculpting them in a manner which distorts their overall symmetry will cause issues with their rotation within the socket. Sculpting Techniques To Avoid Zbrush: Don\u2019t distort the topology in ways that only locally slide. An example would be using a Move brush and locally dragging the model. Such distortions will ultimately make their way into clothing via shape projection, distorting things such as straps and buckles. Zbrush: Don\u2019t use brushes that cause topological pinching/compression. Zbrush brushes such as Pinch or Dam Standard compress and distort the topology in ways which will ultimately make their way into clothing via shape projection. It is much better to use sharp Standard brushes to get similar effects. Zbrush: Do clean up any topological pinching/compression. If, at the end of the sculpting process, you notice topological compression in areas, a good way to clean that up is to: Store a Morph Target of your final sculpt shape. Go down to level 1, and then Subtool Pane>Project>Reproject Higher Subdiv Morph Target Pane>Switch to change back to your original sculpt Using Morph brush, you can brush that clean projection only on the areas that need it. Character Setup Create the Low Resolution Blendshape Zbrush: Do Create a low resolution blendshape. Characters in DAZ Studio are often split into a low resolution blendshape (SD or cage resolution) and high blendshapes (HD or any higher levels above 1). This is similar to a low poly bake object. There are two potential methods for creating this shape. The \u2018Cage\u2019 option in Zbrush. Geometry palette>SDiv set to 1, Cage is next to it. This option moves the cage points into a position they would be if the realtime subdivision state of the model was attempting to approximate the sculpted volume The pros of this method are that it\u2019s easy, and fast. The cons of this method are that it sometimes produces a cage model that is too erratic or \u2018crunchy\u2019 to use. Manually sculpting the low-res model to fit around the high-res sculpt (see this video for an example workflow). The method to do this in Zbrush, is to: duplicate sculpt subtool, lower SDiv level to 1, Del Higher, open Dynamic SubDiv, activate Dynamic. This puts the model into dynamic Subdivision Surface sculpting mode, allowing you to sculpt the model to fit around the HD sculpt in the background. Note: try filling the model with a color to create contrast to allow you see the overlap easier. The pro of this method is that it can be as accurate and clean as you make it. The con of this method is that it is slower and manual work. Suggestion is to try Cage first, inspect the model, and if that didn\u2019t produce a good result, move to the manual method. Load the Blendshapes DAZ Studio: Corrective Blendshapes DAZ Studio: Do connect character specific correctives so that they are driven by the base correctives. Avoid connecting correctives directly to the bone rotations when an existing corrective of the same degree already exists.Better to tweak expression recipes instead of correcting for each individual morph in FACS. It is far too complexCustom Morphs For The Character DAZ Studio: Do group custom morphs the same as the character. For example the Victoria 9 character is located in \u201cActor/People/Feminine\u201d. If a custom nose morph is made to work with her face specifically then it would be grouped under \u201cActor/Head/Face/Nose/People/Feminine\u201d Texturing Skin Textures DAZ Studio: Do use the micro detail normal maps with your skin materials. High quality micro detail normal map textures are included with G9 base package. They are available to anyone to use in material presets only for standard humanoid characters. These textures are not a merchant resource, and are not free to modify and redistribute. Texturing App: Don\u2019t paint brows into your skin textures unless... Brows generally shouldn\u2019t be painted into the skin texture maps. If they are, a browless texture option should always be included so the texture set can easily be used with the geometry-based brows. Eyes DAZ Studio: Use the Eye Library in your MAT presets. Characters should by default use the appropriate free eye material preset in their character MATs Texturing App: Don\u2019t make new eye textures unless\u2026 Characters should only come with new eye textures and materials if a truly unique appearance is the goal, and an existing texture in the Character Essentials Library does not already cover that goal. Mouth Texturing App: Don\u2019t make new mouth textures unless\u2026 Characters should by default always use the core mouth texture and materials unless the character requires a unique visual effect. Eyelashes Texturing App: Don\u2019t texture eyelash colors as individual hairs. Eyelash colors can be achieved using shader tints, or textures with: Solid texture color card fills. A root to tip gradients that fills the entire eyelash card. This allows any of the Eyelash library alphas to be used with the color option. Nipples Texturing App: Do create two torso textures. It is better if your texture comes with two sets of torso maps to support both the Feminine and Masculine nipple placements. Normal Maps DAZ Studio: Do use the main normal maps channel in the shader for your character specific (medium normals) details . Fine details such as pores and such are added via the detail normal map. MATs (Material Presets) DAZ Studio: Do include all the components in your character \u201cAll MAT\u201d files. Character MAT files should include the following figures: Eyes,Eyelashes, Tear, Mouth, Gens m/f. DAZ Studio: Don\u2019t include character specific normals in your \u201cSkin\u201d MAT files. Skin only MATs, or MATs not intended to inject character details onto the figure, should: Include the G9 base figure\u2019s surfaces. Exclude the primary Normal map channel. Include detail Normal map channel. Genitals Bake torso textures to the genitals. A UV map is provided for the G9 base figure which aligns to the UVs of the genitals. This allows texture baking from G9 Torso textures to a Genital UV map, giving a seam-matched head start for the gential textures. Both genitals should be supported in all Tier 1 characters ## Posing When posing it is necessary to remember that there is often more than one way to reach the same pose. Some combinations will work much better than others. If you see bad distortion with a pose evaluate if you can reach that same pose in a way that causes less problems The thigh is a great example. If you want the thigh rotated out to the side with the toes pointing up that can be accomplished with a combination of Side-Side and Bend but it looks awful at the thigh joint. Side-Side and Twist, however, looks great It is possible to build poses that push rotations beyond the set limits. Keep in mind that many joint rotations require a corrective blendshape to make them look correct when rotated to the limits. Turning off limits will allow you to push the rotation beyond but the corrective blendshapes will remain within their limits. For best results, avoid turning off limits except when absolutely necessary Poses should not include the \u201cHeeled Shoe\u201d pose controls (only shoes should use it for their poses)", "title": "G9 Sculpting Workflow"}, {"location": "character_creation/g9_dos_and_donts/#character-sculpting", "text": "", "title": "Character Sculpting"}, {"location": "character_creation/g9_dos_and_donts/#setup", "text": "", "title": "Setup"}, {"location": "character_creation/g9_dos_and_donts/#exporting-the-model-for-zbrush", "text": "DAZ Studio: Do export at Base resolution with the Single UDIM UV set.

The cons of this method are that it sometimes produces a cage model that is too erratic or \u2018crunchy\u2019 to use. Manually sculpting the low-res model to fit around the high-res sculpt (see this video for an example workflow). The method to do this in Zbrush, is to: duplicate sculpt subtool, lower SDiv level to 1, Del Higher, open Dynamic SubDiv, activate Dynamic. This puts the model into dynamic Subdivision Surface sculpting mode, allowing you to sculpt the model to fit around the HD sculpt in the background. Note: try filling the model with a color to create contrast to allow you see the overlap easier. The pro of this method is that it can be as accurate and clean as you make it. The con of this method is that it is slower and manual work. Suggestion is to try Cage first, inspect the model, and if that didn\u2019t produce a good result, move to the manual method.

Plan Clothing for Rigging Rigging a Daz clothing item can be difficult and time-consuming. Expert clothing creators take every shortcut they can. It starts from the planning and design stage. Some articles of clothing, like plate armor, may never deform correctly unless you follow some of these tricks. Keep clothing geometry close to the base mesh Tight-fitting clothing is easier to rig. Loose clothing requires lots of corrections later in the process. Keep details away from joint areas Concentrate details on stable areas with less pose distortion middle of shoulder bones long thigh bones upper chest area If clothing can be worn separately, it should be a separate model. Chains, ropes, or ribbons attached at both ends are hard to rig. Lose hanging chains, ropes, and ribbons are easier to work with Use OBJ vertex group import. This is a trick to import selection sets from an external modeler as weights. Then you add bones to those already weighted parts. It can be especially useful for chains, ropes, and ribbons. Avoid too many rigid parts. They are a lot of work. Plate armor is hard! Place rigid objects on single bones. Thinking about bones while modeling will help when rigging. Move a belt buckle higher or lower to be on a single bone group. It will perform better. Mesh Density Lower-density meshes are easier to work with and perform better. Most people add too much resolution. Life will be easier if you go lower. Fine details should be done in textures, not through modeling. Mesh density should generally be about the same as the character base mesh. Model for SubD. Daz Studio works well with subdivisions. Hold edges with extra loops if necessary. Retopologize simulated cloth to match Genesis mesh density. Rigging high-density meshes is a nightmare and rarely works. Low resolution is usually better. Modeling Model clothing shape to match how the clothing hangs in the reference. Model some wrinkles into the base. Simulating dForce will smooth the mesh overall. Add cloth thickness to mesh, but do not include the backside faces. This is pretty unique to Daz Studio. DO NOT cap clothing model ends (sleeves, collars, or pants). Our smoothing modifier explodes if you do. Make UVs for Texture Artists Make UVs so others can easily modify and create new textures. Texture packing efficiency is not a priority for Daz Studio content. Use flat UVs with vertical alignment for textures. Group UVs by similar type, so they are easy to find in an image editor by a texture artist. Make sure the texture is easy to modify in 2d image editors. Cut UV seams where real-world clothing seams would be. UVs can be updated after rigging, but we avoid it if we can. Test UVs for distortion Test with a vertical stripe and horizontal stripe pattern. If your mesh can hold stripes, it can support General Clothing Rigging Guidelines Rigging clothing in Daz Studio can be quite different from traditional rigging pipelines. Because Genesis is an avatar system, you are making sure the clothing works with multiple Genesis characters. Clothing is rigged to the base character using Transfer Utility Transfer Utility projects bone weights from one figure to another Weighting a low res proxy object is more manageable. Selecting Donor Clothing You can transfer rigging from donor clothing and preserve JCM formulas. MAGIC! Mada's Daz Original Clothing is a great starting place for donor rigging. Select a donor outfit with the closest shape and latest date. Transfer Utility with Presets Script transfers weights and Morphs. Weight Painting Cleanup Weights will already exist from Transfer Utility but may need cleaning. Weight paint with Genesis Base Joint Correctives Turned OFF. Matching Genesis' shape as it deforms is the goal. It will not look perfect yet. That will require Joint Corrective Morphs, which will come later. Use the Add brush to paint weights. The Subtract Brush is unpredictable; it has to put weights somewhere, and it is hard to guess where they will go. Test your weights in multiple joint positions. If a rigid object is shared by two bones, weight rigid objects to one bone. Then, create a JCM for the second bone. Turn Genesis Correctives Back on before building Joint Corrective Morphs. Corrective Morphs Export OBJs to your modeler to make corrective morphs. Check mesh distortion using checker UV patterns. For reference, you can export a posed character OBJ. OBJs brought back into Daz Studio using Morph Loader Pro with Reverse Deformations active. Heavier shapes require more correctives. Correctives activate with Bones (Joint Corrective Morphs: JCMs ) or Morphs (Morphs Corrective Morphs: MCMs ). If your clothing morph has the same name as a morph on Genesis, it will activate automatically with that genesis morph. Other morphs you need to set up manually. Adjustment Morphs Required for Characters (to be updated) Common Corrective Morph Fixes Under arms when the shoulders bend: down forward down + forward Thigh bend forward sitting pose abdomen twist Do not fight auto projection morphs. Just fix the broken mesh. In other words, don't try to fix mesh placement from a different character morph. As a clothing modeler, you cannot control how the character meshes deform. Just make it less broken. If the pose crunches geometry, start from the base mesh to get clean deformations. This is useful for collars and belts. The neck area is challenging to get right because there are a lot of bones in the area. Use the smoothing modifier export/reimport trick!

Clothing JCMs Instructions on creating Joint Corrective Morphs (JCMs) to correct issues with clothing when a joint is rotated. Saving JCMs Sometimes morphs on the figure get projected to follower content (ie. clothing or hair) and messes things up.

Saving Your Clothing Important steps for saving your clothing to a file Cleaning up Clothing Details Summary of getting detail pieces on clothing to work well. Make sure to fix weightmap issues first before dealing with morphs. I show the type of workflow that will serve you well when working on clothing with Genesis 3. Using Smoothing to Fix Clothing Using the smoothing modifier to fix up morph problems in clothing. DAZ Studio automatically projects morphs from Genesis figures to clothing but the results aren't always the best. This shows how to use tools included with DAZ Studio to fix up the morphs. WARNING: Using this method to fix issues is a little heavy handed and can cause issues of its own. For instance, if you rotate the right thigh in to the limit and apply smoothing to fix poke through on a pair of shorts, you are causing the right thigh to intersect with the left and what you can't see is now you are pushing the geometry on the left thigh of the shorts inside the leg. You are fixing one issue but causing another. Fixing Unselectable Geometry How to fix unselectable geometry in Daz Studio.

All your paperwork is complete, and you have your PASS link, now for the good part! Let\u2019s get you making some money. So what happens next? How do I submit my work? Let\u2019s take you through your first PASS submission. These are the critical points in the process. Validation: Before submitting your product, you will use our handy dandy Validator; it will spit out a list of easy-to-fix errors; for example, a needed file is missing. Once your product passes Validation, save your report, and send it in with your product. The validator will be available in your account once you accept the EULA Product Reviews: Once uploaded, our review team will review your work. We meet daily, Monday to Friday, to review all new submissions. At every stage of the process, you will receive an email that tells you if any comments or requests have been made. Please address the comments and if required, make the changes and re-upload your product to the same PASS submission. Our review team may comment on your work. Don\u2019t fret, this is just to ensure that your product meets our quality standards and aims to help your sales. Higher quality = more money in your pocket Declining a product. Our team strives to help you make your product the best it can be, but on the odd occasion, if it doesn't meet our standards (quality or otherwise), we reserve the right to decline it. You can re-submit with changes to meet our standards. Brokering vs. Buyout If you want to offer your product for a buyout, PASS allows you to click Daz O and fill in your desired Buy Out price. Our team will respond, either accept your offer, negotiate a different price or move the item forward as brokered. If Daz buys your product, you will be paid once it passes QA. All future revenue will go to Daz 3D. Artist credit will be yours unless otherwise requested by you. Brokering your product will give you 50% of total revenue (exceptions plugins). Quality Assurance All of our products go through a rigorous QA process. Don\u2019t be surprised if you hear from one of our team asking for revisions. A product will not go live and you will not get paid, until our QA standards are met. Marketing Once you pass QA, Marketing will schedule the release of Brokered Content. When it releases is entirely up to them, average times are within a few weeks. You will be notified on PASS when your product is scheduled so no need to ask. If your product is bought by Daz 3d, the Daz 3d Content team will schedule the release. Don\u2019t be surprised if we hold on to your product for awhile. Often times we have a themed bundle planned that we want your product to be included in. Timelines Average timelines are 30 days from submission to release What impacts these timelines? Review If our team asks for changes the faster you get them to us the faster they get to QA. Please ensure to check our guideline documents to ensure that your products meet ALL guidelines or changes will be requested. QA The more time you spend ensuring that there are no QA errors, the faster it will go through QA. Standard times are 10 business days. Queue Busy times of year affect releases. For example, holidays and sales have an increased load on the staff at Daz 3d. For holidays and themes like Halloween, Christmas etc, please allow a minimum of 6 weeks to ensure that your product will release on time. Release Congrats! You\u2019ve published your product on Daz 3D. Brokered vs Buyout vs Commission There are three avenues that products fall under. Here\u2019s how it works Brokering: This is the most common method of product selling. This just means that the product is put up in the store, and we split the lifetime revenue 50/50. The product rights are still held by the broker (artist). Buyouts: This is when we see a submission we want to buy from the artist for a lump sum instead of splitting the sales. If you want to take the initiative and offer the product as a buyout, you can tick the box that says \"Daz O\" on the PASS page before submitting and listing the price you'd like to sell it for. Your name stays on the product no matter what, but Daz Productions owns the product. This is what you should expect if you sell your product to us. After agreeing to a price, the product will go to QA to be tested. Once it passes, it will be in \"Final QA\" status. Within 2-4 business days, you'll receive a contract that you'll need to sign and return as soon as possible. You'll receive the agreed payment on the next payout date. These dates can be seen in this stickied forum post (Must be a PA to see this post) When the review team offers a buyout for a product that you didn't offer to us, you don't need to feel pressured to accept it. It all depends on whether you want to have sales over time, or receive a lump sum up front. What you choose to do with your products is up to you. Commissions: We like to reach out and collaborate with PA\u2019s to commission content for our DO releases. The themes are always varied so there is something for everyone. The process is built around discussions with the production team (sometimes reference/inspiration images are provided), buyout price is agreed, product developed and then signed off. Once it has passed through QA, contracts and payment is made and you will see your name on the next exciting Daz 3D product release. Pre-Release Daz artists are given early access to major release characters in order to provide supporting content upon release. To access these pre-releases, follow these steps to sign the EULA: Log in Navigate to your account page Go to Vendor Tools At the top of the PA Portal, there will be a notification if there is a EULA to sign Scroll down to the bottom of the page where the EULA appears and sign it Once signed, it will be automatically added to your account where you can download it. *Please note the section in the EULA that prohibits using the pre-release items to create or sell products at other stores within the first 60 days of release. For access to our Stylesheets and typical schedule: These are posted to the PA forums https://www.daz3d.com/forums/categories/pa-discussion. Getting Paid It\u2019s time for the part you\u2019ve been waiting for! PA's can be paid via PayPal, Direct Deposit (United States only), or wire transfer. When do I get paid? PayPal: Every 2 weeks on the 15th and End of the Month Direct Deposit: Once per month, paid out at the end of the Month with a minimum commission payout of $50. Wire Transfer: Once per month at the end of the Month but incurs a $25.00 fee (plus potential further bank charges, check your bank for details) If a pay date falls on a Saturday, payment will be made on Friday. If a payment falls on Sunday, payment will be made on Monday. If a payment falls on a Holiday, payment may be made the day before or the day after the Holiday depending on the day of the week. Payment terms are \u201cNet 30\u201d, meaning payments are made 30 days following the end of the pay period. For example, if you are paid once per month via Wire or Direct Deposit, commissions earned Jan 1-31 are paid at the END of February. If you are paid via PayPal, commissions earned Jan 1-15 are paid Feb 15 and so on. What is my commission? Vendors earn 50% commission on Net Sales. That means 50% of revenue after sales and discounts. Can I earn a bonus or higher commission percentage? Yes, Daz offers bonuses ranging from 30% to 2% to the top 100 Vendors based on 60-day revenue average. If you are eligible for a bonus an online notice will appear on your account. The amount of the bonus will be added to your account several days after the end of the month and will be paid out at the end of the following month with your other month-end payment. Where can I see my product sales? Log in to your Daz account and go to the \u201cVendor Tools\u201d Tab. What are the Payment Cut Off & Pay Out dates? There is a 2020 calendar here showing the dates which payments are made, and when cut-offs are imposed (when handling buyout contracts) so please refer to this if you want to know when your payment will be made.

Life gets in the way sometimes, and that\u2019s fine, but be aware that if we see an extended period of inactivity we reserve the right to revoke your status as a PA and your store will be removed. We will reach out to discuss the situation beforehand, and if the situation can\u2019t be resolved you will get a 10 day notice before termination of your PA status. Even in this instance, we review your back catalogue and may offer to purchase your content so it remains in the store. Interactive Licenses Customers are allowed to use all products on the store for 2D purposes (both for personal and commercial use). To use the product for 3D purposes commercially, customers need to purchase an interactive license. All Daz Originals offer Interactive Licenses.

PASS Stages Explained Here are the stages to expect:: Pending This is prior to submission, we don\u2019t look at products in this status. Any comments made while in this status will likely not be ready Submitted The first stage of approvals. This checks for artistic quality and store eligibility Review The second stage of approvals. This checks for necessary images, naming convention, price, etc. Copy Approval Our in-house copywriter checks the product description for spelling mistakes and grammatical errors Ready to Test This means it\u2019s in the queue and is waiting to be picked up by the next available tester. Depending on the number of submission coming in at any particular time, waits can range from a few days to a couple weeks Testing Product is actively being tested. You may see the status change back to Ready to Test if the tester takes a break or runs out of time for the day. PA Corrections The tester has reached out to you via email about necessary fixes needed to your product. You have access to the files in this stage to update them.

The difficulty comes in cleaning up the transfer so that you get good behavior however users play with the content. If you are setting up a character or prop from scratch you will often want to use the Figure Setup Tool.", "title": "Transfer Utility"}, {"location": "webinars/about_webinars/", "text": "About the Webinars Learn Tips and Tricks for our resident expert - Sr. Technical Artist Josh Darling.

While we recognize that triangulated meshes won't support shear functionality, they will support draping and bends for certain fabric simulation types better than quads.
